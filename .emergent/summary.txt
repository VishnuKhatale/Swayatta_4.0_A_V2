The AI engineer successfully progressed the ERP User Management System from an MVP to a feature-rich application. Initially, it tackled critical UI/UX and security enhancements: a complete sidebar restructure for better navigation, followed by robust granular role-permission enforcement on both frontend and backend. It then implemented advanced table functionalities like pagination, search, and export/import.

Subsequently, the focus shifted to expanding the ERP with a Sales Module. This involved extensive backend development for 16 master tables and transactional tables (Partners, Companies with nested entities), including full CRUD APIs, validation, soft delete, and audit fields. Frontend components for Partners and Master Data were built, integrating the new module into the sidebar with permission checks. The system is now moving towards building detailed Add/Edit forms for Companies, including their nested entities, ensuring full data management capabilities and adherence to all established security and UI standards.

The project involves extending an existing ERP User Management System, which already has Authentication (JWT, refresh, forgot/change password, ), a responsive Dashboard, full CRUD for User, Role, Department, Permission, and Menu Management, Role-Permission Mapping, and Activity/Login Logs Reporting.

The previous phase focused on three priorities:
1.  **Sidebar Restructure**: Exclude Dashboard from collapsible menus. Create User Management main tab (Users, Roles, Departments, Permissions, Role-Permissions, Menus) and Sales main tab (Partners, Companies).
2.  **Granular Role-Permission Enforcement**: Apply permissions per API endpoint and UI component (e.g., hiding buttons, blocking API calls). Admin role should bypass all individual permission checks.
3.  **Pagination, Search, Export & Import for All Tables**: Add these features along with action buttons (add/update/delete) with permission checks.

The current phase (Sales Module) aims to build a Partner & Company Management System with core features:
*   Full CRUD APIs + UI for 16 master tables (e.g., job_function_master, partner_type_master, master_countries) and 2 transactional tables (partners, companies).
*   Soft delete, status flags, and audit fields (, , , ) for all entities.
*   Bulk Import/Export (CSV/XLSX) with validation.
*   Business validations, FK constraints, unique constraints.
*   Multi-level company structure (addresses, contacts, documents, financials) as nested entities.
*   Sidebar integration under the Sales module with sub-tabs for Partners, Companies, nested entities, and Master Data.
*   RBAC + Admin bypass + UI permission checks.
*   Current task: Build Add/Edit forms for Companies, including nested entities (Addresses, Documents, Financials, Contacts) with all required fields, validations, and backend integration.

-   **Full-stack Architecture**: React frontend, FastAPI backend, MongoDB database.
-   **Authentication/Authorization**: JWT, Role-Based Access Control (RBAC), Granular Permissions, Admin Bypass.
-   **Data Management**: CRUD operations, Soft Delete (), Audit Fields.
-   **UI/UX**: Tailwind CSS, Shadcn/ui, Collapsible Navigation, DataTables (with pagination, search, export).
-   **Backend Tools**: Pydantic (for schemas), MongoDB (for data storage).
-   **Frontend Tools**: React Context API, React Router.

<code_architecture>
The application follows a standard full-stack architecture:


-   ****: This is the core backend file. It initially defined existing ERP models, authentication, and CRUD operations. It was extensively modified to:
    -   Add  decorators to existing User and Role endpoints for RBAC.
    -   Implement the Admin role bypass logic in .
    -   Add an  endpoint enhancement to return .
    -   Integrate all 16 new Sales Module master data models (e.g., , , ).
    -   Integrate the 4 new Sales Module transactional models (, , , , , ).
    -   Add generic CRUD API endpoints for all master tables ().
    -   Add full CRUD API endpoints for Partners ().
    -   Add full CRUD API endpoints for Companies and their nested entities (Addresses, Documents, Financials, Contacts) under .

-   ****: The main React application entry point. This file was updated to:
    -   Integrate the  to wrap the .
    -   Add new routes for Sales Module components: , , and generic .
    -   Import new components like , , , and .

-   ****: This component defines the main layout and sidebar navigation. It was modified to:
    -   Implement the new collapsible sidebar structure (User Management, Sales modules) while keeping Dashboard separate.
    -   Integrate  to filter navigation items based on user roles (Admin bypass implemented).

-   ****: A new React Context was created to manage user permissions throughout the frontend. It fetches user permissions and provides a  function and the Admin bypass logic.

-   ****: A new component created to conditionally render UI elements (like buttons) based on the user's permissions.

-   ****: A reusable React component was created to encapsulate common table functionalities like search, pagination, sorting, and CSV export.

-   ****: Initially a placeholder, this component was fully developed to provide CRUD operations for Partners, utilizing the  component and  for permission-based UI.

-   ****: A new component created to provide a tabbed interface for managing all the new master data tables with generic CRUD operations.

-   ****: Initially a placeholder, this component has been updated to render the Companies table using  and is currently being extended to include the Add/Edit forms with nested entities.

The architecture is modular, with clear separation of concerns between backend APIs and frontend UI components, utilizing reusable components and context for state/permission management.

    -   Multi-level forms for nested entities (Addresses, Documents, Financials, Contacts).
    -   All specified validations for company fields and nested entity fields.
    -   Integration with backend CRUD for all nested data.

<current_work>
The AI engineer is currently in the process of building the comprehensive Add/Edit forms for Companies within the Sales Module. This involves modifying the  component. The goal is to create a dynamic form that not only handles the top-level company fields (company\_name, company\_type\_id, partner\_type\_id, head\_of\_company\_id, gst\_no, pan\_no, is\_active) but also integrates tabbed sections for managing nested entities: Addresses, Documents, Financials, and Contacts. Each nested section will have its own set of fields and validation logic.

The latest action () indicates that the AI engineer is continuing to work on this component, specifically adding the edit functionality and the nested entity management structure. This is a complex task requiring careful implementation of form state, dropdowns for foreign key relationships, file upload mechanisms, and comprehensive validation across all levels of the company data structure, while adhering to the existing RBAC and Admin bypass security model. The forms are intended to exactly match the structure of the existing View modal.
