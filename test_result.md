# START - Testing Protocol - DO NOT EDIT OR REMOVE THIS SECTION
#====================================================================================================

# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
# 
## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}
## backend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"
##     file: "file_path.py"
##     stuck_count: 0
##     priority: "high"  # or "medium" or "low"
##     needs_retesting: false
##     status_history:
##         -working: true  # or false or "NA"
##         -agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"
##         -comment: "Detailed comment about status"

##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"
##     file: "file_path.js"
##     stuck_count: 0

##
## agent_communication:
##     -agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"
##     -message: "Communication message between agents"

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

        comment: "❌ CRITICAL BACKEND ISSUE DISCOVERED - Enhanced Partners Management with Company Information NOT IMPLEMENTED in backend API. ✅ BASIC PARTNERS API TESTING: Current Partners API (9/10 tests passed) supports only basic partner information: first_name, last_name, email, phone, job_function_id with proper validation and enrichment. ❌ MISSING ENHANCED FEATURES: Backend Partner model lacks company information fields (company_name, company_type_id, partner_type_id, head_of_company_id, gst_no, pan_no). No unique validation for GST/PAN numbers. No character limits enforcement. No master data integration for company fields. No enhanced data retrieval with company information. ❌ FRONTEND-BACKEND MISMATCH: Frontend expects enhanced Partner API with company fields but backend only supports basic partner data structure. This will cause frontend form submissions to fail or ignore company information fields. ❌ VALIDATION ISSUES: Email uniqueness validation failed (expected 400, got 200) - duplicate emails being accepted. ✅ WORKING FEATURES: Basic partner CRUD operations, job function integration, required field validation, permission enforcement, data enrichment with job function names. RECOMMENDATION: Backend Partner model and API endpoints must be enhanced to support company information fields before frontend can function correctly."

Fixed functools.wraps issue that was causing 422 errors. ✅ AUTHENTICATION REQUIREMENTS: Confirmed all protected endpoints require valid JWT authentication. Proper 403 errors for missing tokens, 401 errors for invalid tokens. ✅ ERROR HANDLING: Verified descriptive error messages for permission failures (e.g., 'Insufficient permissions. Required: view access to /users'). All error responses follow proper HTTP status codes. ✅ PERMISSION DATA STRUCTURE: GET /api/auth/permissions endpoint returns user permissions in correct format: {'/users': ['view', 'create'], '/roles': ['view', 'edit']}. Empty dictionary returned when user has no permissions (expected behavior). ✅ PERMISSION CHECKING LOGIC: get_user_permissions() and check_permission() functions working correctly. Role-permission mappings properly queried from database. Menu path matching working as expected. ✅ DECORATOR IMPLEMENTATION: require_permission decorator properly extracts current_user from function arguments, checks permissions via check_permission(), and raises appropriate HTTPExceptions. ✅ ENDPOINT PROTECTION: Users endpoints (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) properly protected with respective permissions. Roles endpoints (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) properly protected with respective permissions. Non-protected endpoints (menus, permissions, departments) working without restrictions. ✅ COMPREHENSIVE TESTING: Tested 24 scenarios with 91.7% success rate (22/24 passed).
